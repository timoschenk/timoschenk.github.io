I"<p>Hi there! I am a second-year MPhil student at the <a href="https://www.tinbergen.nl/home">Tinbergen Institute</a>
<img style="float: right; width: 30%" src="/assets/Nett.jpg" />
and about to start my PhD in econometrics at the University of Amsterdam.</p>

<p>My research interests lie in causal inference, microeconometric theory, and treatment evaluation. For my MPhil thesis I am currently looking at ways to identify and estimate the effect of an endogenous treatment in panels.</p>

<p>I did my Bachelor in Economics at the University of Mannheim. During that time I spent a semester abroad at the University of Warwick. Seeking hands-on insight into research, I spent a year as Junior Research Manager at the <a href="https://c4ed.org/">Center for Evaluation and Development</a>. Working together with researchers convinced me to take the next step towards a career in academia.</p>

<p>Outside my academic life I am a fanatic volleyball player, trainer and referee at <a href="https://www.svuvolleybal.nl/">SVU Volleybal</a>.</p>
