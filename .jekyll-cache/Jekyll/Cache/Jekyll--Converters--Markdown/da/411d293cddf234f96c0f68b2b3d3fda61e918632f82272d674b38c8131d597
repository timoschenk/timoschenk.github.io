I"t<p>Dobbel is a challenging card game that requires quick reactions. There are 8 symbols on every of the 55 cards, but any pair of cards has exactly one symbol in commom â€“ you have to identify it as quickly as possible. Here is an example pair of cards:</p>

<p>It probably took you more time than you thought to find the answer (spider!). I lost most of the games because I kept thinking of the combinatoric problem behind this game: how is it possible that there is always exactly one common symbol? How many different symbols are in total required to get 55 different cards out of it? More generally, given <script type="math/tex">n</script>  symbols</p>
