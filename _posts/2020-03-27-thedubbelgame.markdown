Dobbel is a challenging card game that requires quick reactions. 
There are 8 symbols on every of the 55 cards, but any pair of cards has exactly one symbol in common -- you have to identify it as quickly as possible. 
Here is an example pair of cards:

<div style="text-align: center"><img src="/assets/pics/dobbel.JPG" width="300" /></div>

It probably took you more time than you thought to find the answer (spider!). 
I lost most of the games because I kept thinking of the combinatoric problem behind this game: how is it possible that there is always exactly one common symbol? 
How many different symbols are in total required to get 55 different cards out of it? 

Let's put this into a general problem. 
How many distinct cards of $$k$$ symbols can be generated from $$n$$ different symbols such that any pair of cards has exaclty one symbol in common?

*Work in progress -- stay tuned*
