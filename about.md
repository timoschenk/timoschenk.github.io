Hi there! I am a second-year MPhil student at the [Tinbergen Institute](https://www.tinbergen.nl/home)
<img style="float: right; width: 30%" src="/assets/Nett.jpg">
and about to start my PhD in econometrics at the University of Amsterdam.

My research interests lie in causal inference, microeconometric theory, and treatment evaluation. For my MPhil thesis I am currently looking at ways to identify and estimate the effect of an endogenous treatment in panels.

I did my Bachelor in Economics at the University of Mannheim. During that time I spent a semester abroad at the University of Warwick. Seeking hands-on insight into research, I spent a year as Junior Research Manager at the [Center for Evaluation and Development](https://c4ed.org/). Working together with researchers convinced me to take the next step towards a career in academia.


Outside my academic life I am a fanatic volleyball player, trainer and referee at [SVU Volleybal](https://www.svuvolleybal.nl/).
