### Working Papers

1. [WP1] [Time-Weighted Difference-in-Differences: Accounting for Common Factors in Short T Panels](https://papers.tinbergen.nl/23004.pdf) *(R&R Journal of Business & Economic Statistics)*

     *Abstract:*
I propose a time-weighted difference-in-differences (TWDID) estimation approach that is robust against time-varying common factors in short T panels. Time weighting substantially reduces both bias and variance compared to an unweighted DID estimator through balancing the pre-treatment and post-treatment factors. To conduct valid inference on the average treatment effect, I develop a correction term that adjusts conventional standard errors for the presence of weight estimation uncertainty. Revisiting a study on the effect of a cap-and-trade program on NOx emissions, TWDID estimation reduces the standard errors of the estimated treatment effect by 10% compared to a conventional DID approach.
