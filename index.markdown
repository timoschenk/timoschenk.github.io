**Time-Weighted Difference-in-Differences: Accounting for Common Factors in Short T Panels** [[Paper]](https://amsuni-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/t_d_schenk_uva_nl/EeRdv-OTbm5IrtXHpGNHlcQBWkbvQfsrl7YqM6osC8CV_g?e=tkXsEp) [[Poster]](https://amsuni-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/t_d_schenk_uva_nl/EbufqXvTGSFJiGRMFQR8hZgBIokthcmH8ZFIjppq36GBNw?e=ugkgoB)

*Abstract:*
I propose a time-weighted difference-in-differences (TWDID) estimation approach that is robust against time-varying common factors in short T panels. Time weighting substantially reduces both bias and variance compared to an unweighted DID estimator through balancing the pre-treatment and post-treatment factors. To conduct valid inference on the average treatment effect, I develop a correction term that adjusts conventional standard errors for the presence of weight estimation uncertainty. Revisiting a study on the effect of a cap-and-trade program on NOx emissions, TWDID estimation reduces the standard errors of the estimated treatment effect by 10% compared to a conventional DID approach.
