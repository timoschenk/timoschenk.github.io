**PhD Student, University of Amsterdam**

Hi there! I am a PhD student in econometrics at the [University of Amsterdam](https://uva.nl/profile/t.d.schenk).

I am particularly interested in causal inference, microeconometric theory, and treatment evaluation. 

I did my Bachelor in Economics at the University of Mannheim. 
During that time I spent a semester abroad at the University of Warwick. 
Seeking hands-on insight into research, I spent a year as Junior Research Manager at the [Center for Evaluation and Development](https://c4ed.org/). 
<!-- Working together with researchers convinced me to take the next step towards a career in academia. -->

Outside my academic life I am an enthusiastic volleyball player, trainer and referee.
