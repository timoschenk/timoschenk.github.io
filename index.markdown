## Timo Schenk
**MPhil student, Tinbergen Institute**

Hi there! I am a second-year MPhil student at the [Tinbergen Institute](https://www.tinbergen.nl/person/1162/timo-daniel-schenk)
and about to start my PhD in econometrics at the University of Amsterdam.

I am particularly interested in causal inference, microeconometric theory, and treatment evaluation. 
For my MPhil thesis I am currently looking at ways to identify and estimate the effect of an endogenous treatment in panels.

I did my Bachelor in Economics at the University of Mannheim. 
During that time I spent a semester abroad at the University of Warwick. 
Seeking hands-on insight into research, I spent a year as Junior Research Manager at the [Center for Evaluation and Development](https://c4ed.org/). 
Working together with researchers convinced me to take the next step towards a career in academia.

Outside my academic life I am an enthusiastic volleyball player, trainer and referee at [SVU Volleybal](https://www.svuvolleybal.nl/).
