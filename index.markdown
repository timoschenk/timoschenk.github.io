# Personal Website

Welcome! I am a PhD candidate at the University of Amsterdam and the Tinbergen Institute. I will be available on the 2023/24 academic job market.

My research advances the econometric methods in the field of causal inference with panel data.
In my [job market paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/130-EkbrX10qEfPcEJa-mZc1i5pk4P94o/view?usp=drive_link){:target="_blank"}, I develop strategies to identify the mechanisms behind treatment effects in difference-in-differences designs.
My current papers have applications in environmental economics, economic history and public health.

My advisors are  [Frank Kleibergen](https://ase.uva.nl/profile/k/l/f.r.kleibergen/f.r.kleibergen.html){:target="_blank"} and [Andreas Pick](http://apick.eu/){:target="_blank"}.
Last spring I was a Visiting Research Fellow at Brown University, invited by [Toru Kitagawa](https://sites.google.com/brown.edu/torukitagawa){:target="_blank"}.
Before my graduate studies I was a Junior Research Manager at the [Center for Evaluation and Development](https://c4ed.org/){:target="_blank"} and I obtained my bachelor's degree at the University of Mannheim.

### Working papers

1. [Mediation Analysis in Difference-in-Differences Designs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/130-EkbrX10qEfPcEJa-mZc1i5pk4P94o/view?usp=drive_link){:target="_blank"} [**<ins>Job Market Paper</ins>**] *(honorable mention at the IAAE 2023)*

   *Abstract:*
    This paper develops strategies to understand the mechanisms behind treatment effects in difference-in-differences (DiD) designs. 
    Building on concepts from mediation analysis, I present identification strategies for the part of the average treatment effect that is caused by the treatment affecting a mediating variable. 
    The sequential DiD approach requires additional parallel trend assumptions, a restriction on the mediator effect heterogeneity, and monotonicity of the treatment effect on the mediator. 
    To avoid some of these restrictions, I present a two-sample approach, which includes results from other studies. 
    I propose robust inference procedures on the proportion of the total effect a particular channel can explain. 
    I revisit two empirical studies to show how researchers can use these approaches in practice.


1. [Time-Weighted Difference-in-Differences: Accounting for Common Factors in Short T Panels](https://papers.tinbergen.nl/23004.pdf){:target="_blank"} [WP2] *(R&R Journal of Business & Economic Statistics)*


     *Abstract:*
I propose a time-weighted difference-in-differences (TWDID) estimation approach that is robust against time-varying common factors in short T panels. Time weighting substantially reduces both bias and variance compared to an unweighted DID estimator through balancing the pre-treatment and post-treatment factors. To conduct valid inference on the average treatment effect, I develop a correction term that adjusts conventional standard errors for the presence of weight estimation uncertainty. Revisiting a study on the effect of a cap-and-trade program on NOx emissions, TWDID estimation reduces the standard errors of the estimated treatment effect by 10% compared to a conventional DID approach.
