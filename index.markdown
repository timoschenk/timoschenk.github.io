# Personal Website

Welcome! I am a PhD candidate at the University of Amsterdam and the Tinbergen Institute. I will be available on the 2023/24 academic job market.

My research advances the econometric methods in the field of causal inference with panel data.
In my [job market paper](comingsoon.md), I develop two approaches to identify the mechanisms behind treatment effects in difference-in-differences designs.
My current papers have applications in environmental economics, economic history and public health.

My advisors are  [Frank Kleibergen](https://ase.uva.nl/profile/k/l/f.r.kleibergen/f.r.kleibergen.html) and [Andreas Pick](http://apick.eu/).
Last spring I was a Visiting Research Fellow at Brown University, invited by [Toru Kitagawa](https://sites.google.com/brown.edu/torukitagawa).
Before my graduate studies I was a Junior Research Manager at the [Center for Evaluation and Development](https://c4ed.org/) and I obtained my bachelors degree at the University of Mannheim.

## Research

*Field (primary):* Econometrics

*Field (secondary):* Causal inference, Applied microeconometrics

### Working papers

1. [Mediation Analysis in Difference-in-Differences Designs](comingsoon.md) [**<ins>Job Market Paper</ins>**] *(honorable mention at the IAAE 2023)*

    *Draft & Abstract available soon*

2. [Time-Weighted Difference-in-Differences: Accounting for Common Factors in Short T Panels](https://papers.tinbergen.nl/23004.pdf) [WP2] *(R&R Journal of Business & Economic Statistics)*

     *Abstract:*
I propose a time-weighted difference-in-differences (TWDID) estimation approach that is robust against time-varying common factors in short T panels. Time weighting substantially reduces both bias and variance compared to an unweighted DID estimator through balancing the pre-treatment and post-treatment factors. To conduct valid inference on the average treatment effect, I develop a correction term that adjusts conventional standard errors for the presence of weight estimation uncertainty. Revisiting a study on the effect of a cap-and-trade program on NOx emissions, TWDID estimation reduces the standard errors of the estimated treatment effect by 10% compared to a conventional DID approach.
